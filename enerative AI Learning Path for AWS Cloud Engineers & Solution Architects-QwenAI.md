## 🧭 Detailed Learning Roadmap

### Step 1: Foundations of Generative AI
Understand how LLMs work, their capabilities, and limitations.

- **Course**: [AWS Generative AI Fundamentals](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/course/external/view/elearning/26687/aws-generative-ai-fundamentals) (Free)
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Transformers, tokens, inference
  - Use cases: text, code, images
  - Responsible AI, security, cost

---

### Step 2: Prompt Engineering
Learn to write effective prompts for better outputs.

- **Course**: [ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/) (Free, by Andrew Ng)
- **Hands-on**: Use [Amazon Bedrock Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) to test prompts
- **Tips for AWS Use**:
  - Prompt: _“Generate a CloudFormation template for a secure VPC with public and private subnets in us-east-1”_
  - Prompt: _“Write a Python Lambda function to stop idle EC2 instances”_

---

### Step 3: AWS Bedrock & LLM Integration
Use AWS’s managed service for foundation models.

- **Resources**:
  - [Amazon Bedrock User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/what-is-bedrock.html)
  - [Bedrock Sample Notebooks (GitHub)](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-bedrock-samples)
- **Lab**: Run inference using Claude, Llama, or Titan models via API

```python
import boto3
client = boto3.client('bedrock-runtime')
response = client.invoke_model(modelId='anthropic.claude-v2', body=...)
```

---

### Step 4: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
Make LLMs smarter with your internal data.

- **Use Case**: Ask LLMs about your AWS architecture docs or security policies.
- **Workshop**: [RAG with Amazon Bedrock](https://catalog.workshops.aws/genai-application-development/en-US/200-level/rag)
- **Steps**:
  1. Ingest documents into S3
  2. Use Bedrock + Titan embeddings to create vector DB
  3. Query with semantic search + LLM

---

### Step 5: Vector Databases on AWS
Store and query embeddings efficiently.

- **Options**:
  - Amazon OpenSearch Serverless (vector support)
  - AWS MemoryDB or RDS for smaller setups
- **Tutorial**: [Vector Search with OpenSearch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/vector-search.html)

---

### Step 6: Agentic AI & Autonomous Agents
Build agents that plan, act, and reflect.

- **What is MCP?**: A standard for agents to share tools, results, and context.
- **Source**: [Anthropic MCP GitHub](https://github.com/anthropics/mcp)
- **Relevance**: Future-proof agent interoperability (e.g., AWS DevOps agent talks to Security Hub agent)

---

### Step 8: Vibe Coding & AI Pair Programming
Use AI to speed up coding.
